# Gear Case Finder Admin Dashboard Redesign Plan

## Core Functionality Analysis
The Gear Case Finder application's primary purpose is to match audio gear with compatible protective cases based on dimensions and other criteria. It uses a sophisticated matching algorithm that:

1. Calculates compatibility scores between gear and cases
2. Considers dimensions, protection level, features, and user feedback
3. Stores matches in a database for future reference
4. Allows users to search for gear, find compatible cases, and provide feedback

## Data Models
The application uses three main data models:

1. **AudioGear** - Represents audio equipment with:
   - Dimensions (length, width, height)
   - Brand, category, type
   - Weight, images, description
   - Popularity and availability information

2. **Case** - Represents protective cases with:
   - Interior dimensions (critical for matching)
   - Exterior dimensions (optional)
   - Protection level, features (waterproof, shockproof, etc.)
   - Material, color, brand, type
   - Price, rating, review count

3. **GearCaseMatch** - Represents the relationship between gear and compatible cases:
   - References to gear and case IDs
   - Compatibility score (overall)
   - Dimension score, feature score, user feedback score
   - User feedback counts (positive/negative)
   - Dimension fit information

## Existing Admin API Endpoints
Only three admin API endpoints are currently implemented:

1. `/api/admin/cache-stats` - Returns cache statistics
2. `/api/admin/clear-cache` - Clears the application cache
3. `/api/admin/database-stats` - Returns database statistics (counts of gear, cases, matches)

## Proposed Admin Dashboard Structure

### 1. Database Management
- **Audio Gear Management**
  - View all gear with filtering and sorting
  - Add, edit, delete gear items
  - Bulk import/export functionality
  - View gear details with dimensions visualization

- **Case Management**
  - View all cases with filtering and sorting
  - Add, edit, delete case items
  - Bulk import/export functionality
  - View case details with dimensions visualization

- **Match Management**
  - View all matches with filtering by compatibility score
  - Manually create/edit matches
  - Delete incorrect matches
  - View match details with dimension fit visualization

### 2. Matching System
- **Algorithm Configuration**
  - Set minimum compatibility thresholds
  - Adjust dimension fit scoring parameters
  - Configure feature importance weights
  - Set protection level requirements

- **Manual Matching Operations**
  - Run matching algorithm for specific gear
  - Batch process multiple gear items
  - View matching results with detailed scores
  - Save or discard generated matches

- **Match Statistics**
  - View distribution of compatibility scores
  - Analyze dimension fit patterns
  - Track match quality metrics over time
  - Identify problematic gear or cases

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- **Cache Management**
  - View cache statistics (size, hit rate, etc.)
  - Clear cache (full or selective)
  - Configure cache parameters (TTL, max size)
  - Monitor cache performance

- **API Usage Metrics**
  - Track API endpoint usage
  - Monitor response times
  - Identify performance bottlenecks
  - View error rates and types

- **Database Performance**
  - Monitor collection sizes and growth
  - Track query performance
  - View index usage statistics
  - Optimize database operations

### 4. User Feedback Analysis
- **Feedback Management**
  - View all user feedback on matches
  - Filter feedback by score, date, gear/case
  - Respond to user feedback
  - Flag problematic feedback

- **Feedback Analytics**
  - Analyze feedback patterns by gear type
  - Identify cases with consistently positive/negative feedback
  - Track feedback trends over time
  - Generate reports on match quality based on user feedback

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Dashboard Structure
1. Create new AdminLayout component with appropriate navigation
2. Implement Dashboard overview page with key metrics
3. Create Database Management section with basic CRUD operations
4. Implement necessary API endpoints for database operations

### Phase 2: Matching System
1. Develop interface for algorithm configuration
2. Create manual matching operation tools
3. Implement match statistics visualization
4. Add necessary API endpoints for matching operations

### Phase 3: Performance Monitoring
1. Enhance existing cache management interface
2. Implement API usage tracking and visualization
3. Add database performance monitoring tools
4. Create necessary API endpoints for monitoring

### Phase 4: User Feedback System
1. Develop feedback management interface
2. Create feedback analytics visualization
3. Implement feedback response system
4. Add necessary API endpoints for feedback management

## Technical Requirements
1. Use React with TypeScript for frontend components
2. Implement server-side API endpoints with Next.js
3. Use MongoDB for data storage
4. Implement proper authentication for admin access
5. Ensure responsive design for all dashboard components
6. Add comprehensive error handling
7. Include loading states for asynchronous operations

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for redesigning the Admin Dashboard to accurately reflect the Gear Case Finder application's core functionality and provide useful administrative tools.
