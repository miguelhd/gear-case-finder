# Marketplace Scraping Research

## Overview
This document summarizes the research findings on scraping policies, technical approaches, and challenges for the major marketplaces we need to integrate with for the Musician Case Finder website.

## Amazon

### Scraping Policies
- Scraping publicly available data is legal but must comply with Amazon's terms of service
- Amazon's terms prohibit "using any automated process or technology to access, acquire, copy, or monitor any part of the Amazon Website"
- Cannot scrape data behind login walls or personal information
- Amazon can block IP addresses suspected of scraping but cannot legally prosecute for scraping public data

### Technical Challenges
- Advanced anti-bot detection that can block after just a couple of requests
- CAPTCHA challenges
- IP address blocking
- Rate limiting
- Browser fingerprinting
- Header analysis

### Data Available for Scraping
- Product names
- Descriptions
- Prices
- Sellers
- Images
- Features
- Reviews
- Ratings
- Best sellers
- Availabilities
- Shipping information
- Return policies

### Recommended Approach
- Use rotating proxies to avoid IP blocks
- Implement proper headers and user agents
- Mimic real user behavior
- Consider using a structured data endpoint service like ScraperAPI
- Implement proper rate limiting and delays between requests

## eBay

### Scraping Policies
- Similar to Amazon, scraping public data is generally allowed but must comply with eBay's terms
- eBay has implemented anti-scraping measures over the years

### Technical Challenges
- Anti-scraping measures that can lead to blocks
- JavaScript-rendered content
- Dynamic content loading

### Data Available for Scraping
From search results pages:
- Product links
- Titles
- Prices
- Ratings
- Images

From product pages:
- Price
- Availability
- Product title
- Product rating
- Product image
- Shipping cost
- Item specifics

### Recommended Approach
- Use specialized APIs like Oxylabs' eBay Scraper API
- Implement proper parsing with CSS or XPath selectors
- Consider geo-location parameters for localized results
- Handle pagination properly

## Etsy

### Scraping Policies
- Scraping public data is generally allowed but must comply with Etsy's terms
- Etsy employs anti-scraping measures to prevent bot activity

### Technical Challenges
- Anti-bot measures including CAPTCHAs
- IP tracking
- Need for proper headers and user agents

### Data Available for Scraping
From product pages:
- Product image
- Title
- Ratings and number of votes
- Price, discount, and discount end date
- Seller's name
- Special tags ("Star Seller", "FREE shipping", etc.)

From product listings:
- More detailed product information
- More images
- Seller information
- Product highlights
- Descriptions
- Detailed ratings
- Customer reviews
- Shipping information

### Recommended Approach
- Use proxies to change IP addresses
- Set up proper headers and user agents
- Consider using specialized APIs like Oxylabs' Etsy Scraper API
- Parse JSON responses properly

## AliExpress

### Scraping Policies
- Scraping public data is generally allowed but must comply with AliExpress's terms
- Legal considerations mentioned in the research include not scraping at rates that could damage the website

### Technical Challenges
- Product data is stored in JavaScript variables in the HTML source
- Need to extract data using regex patterns
- Pagination handling

### Data Available for Scraping
- Product IDs
- URLs
- Types (natural or ad)
- Titles
- Prices
- Currencies
- Trade information
- Thumbnails
- Store information

### Recommended Approach
- Extract data from JavaScript variables using regex
- Implement proper parsing for product previews
- Handle pagination for search results
- Consider using specialized APIs or services

## Temu

### Scraping Policies
- As a newer platform, specific policies weren't detailed in the research
- General web scraping best practices apply

### Technical Challenges
- Dynamic, JavaScript-rendered pages
- CAPTCHA challenges
- Traditional scraping methods are difficult

### Data Available for Scraping
- Product name
- Price
- Rating and reviews
- Product description
- Image URL
- Discounts and offers

### Recommended Approach
- Use a service like Crawlbase Crawling API that can handle JavaScript-rendered content
- Implement IP rotation to bypass security checks
- Set up proper Python environment with necessary libraries
- Handle pagination properly

## General Best Practices for All Marketplaces

1. **Legal Compliance**:
   - Only scrape publicly available data
   - Respect robots.txt files
   - Don't scrape personal information
   - Don't overload servers with requests

2. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Use rotating proxies
   - Implement proper headers and user agents
   - Add delays between requests
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Implement retries with exponential backoff

3. **Data Management**:
   - Normalize data from different sources
   - Implement proper data validation
   - Store data efficiently
   - Implement regular update schedules

4. **Recommended Tools**:
   - Python with libraries like requests, httpx, BeautifulSoup, or Scrapy
   - Specialized APIs like ScraperAPI, Oxylabs, or Crawlbase
   - Proxy services for IP rotation
   - Database systems for efficient storage

## Conclusion

Scraping these marketplaces presents various challenges but is feasible with the right approach. For our Musician Case Finder website, we'll need to implement specialized scrapers for each marketplace, taking into account their unique structures and anti-scraping measures. Using specialized APIs may be more efficient than building custom scrapers from scratch, especially for marketplaces with strong anti-scraping measures.

The data we collect will need to be normalized to a common format to facilitate the product matching algorithm that will connect audio gear with suitable cases.
