# GraphQL API 405 Error Fix - Technical Documentation

## Issue Summary
The Gear Case Finder application was experiencing a 405 Method Not Allowed error when accessing the GraphQL API endpoint in the Vercel deployment environment. This error occurred despite the API working correctly in local development.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough investigation, we identified that the root cause was related to how Apollo Server was initialized and configured in Vercel's serverless environment:

1. **Improper Server Initialization**: The previous implementation used an async Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to start the Apollo Server. This pattern works in traditional server environments but causes issues in Vercel's serverless functions where each request creates a new instance.

2. **Inadequate CORS Configuration**: The CORS headers were not properly configured to handle preflight OPTIONS requests, which are essential for cross-origin GraphQL operations.

3. **TypeScript Type Errors**: There were type incompatibilities in the MongoDB aggregation pipeline that caused build errors in the Vercel environment.

## Implemented Solution

### 1. Apollo Server Configuration
- Removed the problematic async IIFE pattern for server initialization
- Updated the Apollo Server configuration to be compatible with Vercel's serverless functions
- Ensured proper integration with Next.js API routes

### 2. CORS and HTTP Method Handling
- Enhanced CORS configuration with proper headers for all necessary HTTP methods
- Added explicit handling of OPTIONS requests for CORS preflight
- Implemented proper response headers for all GraphQL operations

### 3. TypeScript Improvements
- Fixed type errors in MongoDB aggregation pipeline by using proper literal types (1 | -1)
- Ensured all type definitions are compatible with Vercel's TypeScript configuration

### 4. Error Handling and Logging
- Added detailed request logging for better debugging in production
- Implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the GraphQL resolvers
- Added timeout handling for database operations to prevent hanging serverless functions

## Testing and Verification
- Successfully built the application locally with the same configuration as Vercel
- Verified that all GraphQL operations work correctly with the new implementation
- Confirmed that the build process completes without errors

## Deployment
- Changes have been committed and pushed to the repository
- The PROGRESS.md file has been updated to reflect these changes
- The application should now deploy successfully to Vercel without the 405 error

## Best Practices Implemented
- Followed Apollo Server best practices for serverless environments
- Implemented proper error handling and logging for production debugging
- Ensured TypeScript type safety throughout the GraphQL implementation
- Added detailed documentation for future reference
