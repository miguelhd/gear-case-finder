   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miguelhd/gear-case-finder.git
   cd gear-case-finder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/musician-case-finder
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Test MongoDB connection**
   ```bash
   npm run db:test-connection
   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

6. **Start the development server**

  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- **Open Cypress test runner**
  ```bash
  npm run cypress
  ```

## üìä Database Structure

The application uses MongoDB with the following collection structure:

### Collections

- **AudioGear**: Stores information about audio equipment
  - Indexes: `brand`, `category`, `type`, dimensions, text search on name and description

- **Case**: Stores information about protective cases
  - Indexes: `brand`, `type`, interior dimensions, protection features, text search on name and description

- **GearCaseMatch**: Stores matches between gear and cases
  - Indexes: unique compound index on `gearId` and `caseId`, sorted indexes for compatibility scores

- **User**: Stores user information and preferences

- **Content**: Stores static content for the application

- **Analytics**: Stores usage analytics and metrics

- **Affiliate**: Stores affiliate marketing information

## üîÑ API Integration

The application uses API-based data sources instead of web scraping for improved reliability and maintainability.

### API Clients

- **Canopy API Client**: Provides access to product data across multiple marketplaces
- **Reverb API Client**: Specialized API for musical instruments and gear

### Data Flow

1. User searches for gear or cases
2. API clients fetch data from respective sources
3. Data is normalized to a common format
4. Results are cached for performance
5. Matching algorithm finds compatible gear-case pairs
6. Results are presented to the user

## üë®‚Äçüíª Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides comprehensive tools for managing and monitoring the application.

### Dashboard Features

- **System Monitoring**: View system health, performance metrics, and logs
- **Database Management**: Manage database collections, view stats, and import data
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts and permissions
- **Content Management**: Update static content and manage the content database

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to `/admin` in the application
2. Log in with admin credentials
3. Access the various admin tools from the sidebar navigation

## üö¢ Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on Vercel's serverless platform.

### Deployment Checklist

1. Ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved (`npm run build` locally)
2. Verify that development scripts are excluded from the build
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Ensure API routes handle errors correctly
5. Verify file paths use environment-specific directories

### Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` file configures the deployment with:
- Build commands and output directory
- API route rewrites
- CORS headers for API routes
- Environment variables

## üß™ Testing

The application includes comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

### Unit Tests

- Component tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Utility function tests
- API route tests

### Integration Tests

- Database connection and query tests
- API integration tests
- Component integration tests

### End-to-End Tests

- User flow tests using Cypress
- Admin dashboard tests
- Search and matching functionality tests
