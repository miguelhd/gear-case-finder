# TypeScript System Audit Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our systematic approach to addressing recurring TypeScript errors in the Gear Case Finder project.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Inconsistent interface design
2. Lack of type checking during development
3. Incomplete testing before integration
4. Implicit vs. explicit properties

## Systematic Approach

### 1. Comprehensive Type System Audit
- Scan all interfaces and their implementations
- Create a complete map of dependencies between components
- Identify all mismatches between defined types and their usage

### 2. Stricter TypeScript Configuration
- Update tsconfig.json with stricter settings
- Add ESLint rules to catch type inconsistencies early

### 3. Interface Documentation and Style Guide
- Document all interfaces with clear requirements
- Create consistent naming conventions

### 4. Fix All Identified Type Inconsistencies
- Address all issues found in the audit
- Ensure consistent property naming across the codebase

### 5. Integration Tests
- Add tests that verify components work together correctly
- Test the entire data flow from API to database

## Current Progress
- Identified multiple TypeScript errors related to:
  - Missing properties in interfaces (marketplace, price, currency, etc.)
  - Incorrect method signatures (cacheService.set, imageDownloader.downloadImage)
  - Inconsistent naming conventions
  - Missing exports (GearCaseMatch vs. IGearCaseMatch)

- Fixed some immediate issues:
  - Added missing properties to IAudioGear interface
  - Fixed cacheService.set method call with proper options object
  - Started implementing API alternatives to replace scrapers

## Next Steps
Continue with the systematic approach outlined above, starting with a comprehensive type system audit.
