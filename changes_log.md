## GraphQL Schema Validation Fix

### Issue
- 405 Method Not Allowed error in GraphQL API endpoint
- Error persisted despite previous fixes to vercel.json and Apollo Server implementation
- Root cause: Reserved field name "__typename" in both GraphQL schema and resolvers

### Changes Made
1. Replaced reserved "__typename" field with "apiStatus" in src/graphql/schema.ts
2. Updated corresponding resolver in src/graphql/resolvers.ts to use "apiStatus" instead of "__typename"
3. Cleaned build cache and rebuilt project to ensure changes took effect
4. Updated PROGRESS.md with documentation of the fix

### Files Modified
- src/graphql/schema.ts - Replaced "__typename: String!" with "apiStatus: String!"
- src/graphql/resolvers.ts - Replaced "__typename: () => 'Query'" with "apiStatus: () => 'API is operational'"
- PROGRESS.md - Added section "11. GraphQL Schema Validation Fix" documenting the changes

### Commits
1. "Fix: Replace reserved __typename field with apiStatus in GraphQL schema and resolvers"
2. "Update PROGRESS.md with GraphQL schema validation fix documentation"

### Expected Outcome
- Successful GraphQL schema validation during server initialization
- Properly functioning GraphQL API endpoint without 405 Method Not Allowed errors
- Correct handling of GraphQL operations in both local and production environments

## Database Seeding Script Implementation

### Added Files
- `/scripts/seed/seed-db.js`: Main database seeding script
- `/scripts/seed/generators/audio-gear.js`: Generator for audio gear data
- `/scripts/seed/generators/cases.js`: Generator for protective cases data
- `/scripts/seed/generators/matches.js`: Generator for gear-case compatibility matches
- `/scripts/seed/generators/users.js`: Generator for user profiles
- `/scripts/seed/generators/content.js`: Generator for content items
- `/scripts/seed/generators/analytics.js`: Generator for analytics data
- `/scripts/seed/generators/affiliates.js`: Generator for affiliate program data

### Changes
- Updated `PROGRESS.md` with details of the database seeding script implementation
- Created `todo.md` to track implementation progress

### Features Implemented
- Comprehensive database seeding script with mock data for all seven collections
- Realistic data generation with proper relationships between collections
- Configurable data volume for testing different scenarios
- Compatibility scoring algorithm for matching gear with cases
- Proper error handling and logging throughout the seeding process
- Index creation for optimized queries
- Verification of local test suite compatibility with Vercel deployment environment

### Testing
- Successfully tested the seeding script by populating the MongoDB database
- Verified that the local test suite is compatible with a default Vercel installation
- Confirmed that the GraphQL API works correctly with the seeded data
