### Added
- **API Clients**
  - Created `canopy-api-client.ts` for accessing Canopy API
  - Implemented `reverb-api-client.ts` for Reverb API integration
  - Added data mappers for transforming API responses to our data models

- **Caching and Optimization**
  - Implemented `api-cache-service.ts` for MongoDB-based caching
  - Created `dimension-cache-service.ts` for permanent instrument dimension caching
  - Added pre-populated dimension data in `instrument-dimensions-data.ts`
  - Implemented accessory space support in dimension matching

- **Batch Processing**
  - Created `batch-processing-system.ts` for scheduled data refreshes
  - Added job tracking and history in MongoDB

- **Integration Components**
  - Implemented `api-manager.ts` to replace ScraperManager
  - Created `api-integration-service.ts` for compatibility with existing code
  - Added `api-factory.ts` for creating API components

- **Testing and Documentation**

  - Updated PROGRESS.md with detailed documentation

### Changed
- Replaced scraper-based approach with API-based approach
- Maintained compatibility with existing data models and workflows
- Preserved MongoDB integration and image handling functionality

### Removed
- No functionality has been removed, only enhanced with API alternatives

## API Strategy
- Using Canopy API as primary solution for marketplace products
- Using Reverb API for musical instruments and gear
- Implementing dimension-specific optimizations to minimize API calls
- Adding support for accessory space in case matching

## Next Steps
- Implement additional API integrations (Dimensions.com, specialized case sources)
- Enhance dimension matching algorithm
- Optimize performance with Redis caching
