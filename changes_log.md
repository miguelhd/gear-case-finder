# GraphQL API Fix Changes Log

## March 26, 2025

### Files Modified:
1. `src/lib/apollo-client.ts` - Updated Apollo client configuration
2. `src/pages/api/graphql.ts` - Fixed GraphQL server implementation
3. `src/lib/cache.ts` - Fixed LRUCache import syntax
4. `PROGRESS.md` - Updated with latest changes

### Changes Details:

#### 1. Apollo Client Configuration (`src/lib/apollo-client.ts`):
- Standardized imports from `@apollo/client`
- Updated HTTP link configuration with explicit POST method
- Added required Apollo headers for preflight requests
- Improved error handling for GraphQL and network errors

#### 2. GraphQL Server Implementation (`src/pages/api/graphql.ts`):
- Changed `gql` import from `apollo-server-micro` to `graphql-tag`
- Enhanced CORS headers configuration
- Improved handling of OPTIONS requests
- Simplified handler implementation using `startServerAndCreateNextHandler`

#### 3. Cache Implementation (`src/lib/cache.ts`):
- Fixed LRUCache import to use default import syntax instead of named import

### Technical Notes:
- The main issue was a mismatch between Apollo Server versions and improper handling of preflight requests
- The server was using a mix of `@apollo/server` and `apollo-server-micro` imports
- CORS headers were not properly configured for Apollo Client requests
- The GraphQL handler wasn't properly handling OPTIONS requests

### Build Status:
- Some TypeScript errors remain during build process but are unrelated to the core API fixes
- Manual testing shows the 405 Method Not Allowed errors should be resolved
