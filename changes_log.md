# Gear Case Finder - Changes Log

## UI Component Restructuring

1. Created a new directory structure for case detail components:
   - `/src/components/case-detail/` to house all the extracted components

2. Extracted these components from the original file:
   - `Breadcrumbs.tsx` - Navigation breadcrumbs component
   - `ImageGallery.tsx` - Image display component with thumbnails
   - `CaseDetails.tsx` - Main case information display
   - `CaseProperties.tsx` - Visual indicators for waterproof, shockproof, etc.
   - `SellerInfo.tsx` - Seller information display

3. Refactored the main `cases/[id].tsx` file to:
   - Import and use these smaller components
   - Maintain all the original functionality
   - Be more maintainable and less prone to clipping

## GraphQL API Fixes

1. Added missing dependencies to package.json:
   - `apollo-server-micro`: Required for GraphQL API functionality
   - `micro-cors`: Required for CORS support in API routes

2. Fixed TypeScript errors in GraphQL implementation:
   - Added proper type annotations for query and sort objects
   - Added explicit type annotations to resolver functions
   - Fixed error handling in GraphQL resolvers

## TypeScript Error Fixes

1. Fixed import paths in pages:
   - Updated import paths in `/pages/cases/index.tsx` from `../components/ui` to `../../components/ui`
   - Updated import paths in `/pages/gear/index.tsx` from `../components/ui` to `../../components/ui`

2. Fixed component props issues:
   - Changed RangeSlider implementation to use standard HTML range inputs
   - Updated Card component usage to match its interface (link instead of href, image instead of imageUrl)
   - Removed unsupported 'indeterminate' property from Checkbox components
   - Replaced 'footer' with 'description' in Card components

3. Added null checks for potentially undefined values:
   - Added checks for data?.paginatedCases?.items
   - Added checks for data?.paginatedCases?.pagination

4. Fixed state management:
   - Changed price range from array state to separate min/max states
   - Updated filter logic to use new state variables

## Build Process Fixes

1. Successfully fixed all TypeScript errors
2. Verified build process works without errors
3. All pages now compile successfully

## Strategies Implemented to Prevent Clipping

1. Component Decomposition:
   - Broke down large components into smaller, focused components
   - Created dedicated directories for related components

2. Type Safety:
   - Added explicit TypeScript interfaces for all components
   - Used proper type annotations for function parameters and return values

3. Null Safety:
   - Added null checks for all potentially undefined values
   - Used optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators

4. Import Path Consistency:
   - Standardized import paths across the application
   - Fixed relative paths to use correct directory structure
