## TypeScript Error Fix in Scrapers Page

### Issue
- Deployment to Vercel was failing with a TypeScript error in `src/pages/admin/scrapers.tsx`
- Error message: `Type error: Argument of type 'any' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'`
- The error occurred on line 87 where `selectedScrapers.includes(scraperId)` was called

### Root Cause
- The `selectedScrapers` state was initialized as an empty array without type annotation: `useState([])`
- TypeScript inferred this as `never[]` type, causing type errors when trying to use array methods like `includes()`
- The `scraperId` parameter in the `toggleScraperSelection` function was also missing type annotation

### Fix Implemented
1. Added proper type annotation to the `selectedScrapers` state:
   ```typescript
   const [selectedScrapers, setSelectedScrapers] = useState<string[]>([]);
   ```

2. Added type annotation to the `scraperId` parameter:
   ```typescript
   const toggleScraperSelection = (scraperId: string) => {
   ```

3. Verified the fix with a successful local build
4. Updated PROGRESS.md with details about the fix
5. Committed and pushed changes to the repository

### Verification
- Local build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- All functionality remains intact with minimal changes to the codebase
