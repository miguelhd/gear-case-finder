## GraphQL Schema Validation Fix

### Issue
- 405 Method Not Allowed error in GraphQL API endpoint
- Error persisted despite previous fixes to vercel.json and Apollo Server implementation
- Root cause: Reserved field name "__typename" in both GraphQL schema and resolvers

### Changes Made
1. Replaced reserved "__typename" field with "apiStatus" in src/graphql/schema.ts
2. Updated corresponding resolver in src/graphql/resolvers.ts to use "apiStatus" instead of "__typename"
3. Cleaned build cache and rebuilt project to ensure changes took effect
4. Updated PROGRESS.md with documentation of the fix

### Files Modified
- src/graphql/schema.ts - Replaced "__typename: String!" with "apiStatus: String!"
- src/graphql/resolvers.ts - Replaced "__typename: () => 'Query'" with "apiStatus: () => 'API is operational'"
- PROGRESS.md - Added section "11. GraphQL Schema Validation Fix" documenting the changes

### Commits
1. "Fix: Replace reserved __typename field with apiStatus in GraphQL schema and resolvers"
2. "Update PROGRESS.md with GraphQL schema validation fix documentation"

### Expected Outcome
- Successful GraphQL schema validation during server initialization
- Properly functioning GraphQL API endpoint without 405 Method Not Allowed errors
- Correct handling of GraphQL operations in both local and production environments
