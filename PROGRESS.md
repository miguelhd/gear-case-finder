### Vercel Deployment Error Fix - LRUCache Implementation

#### Issues Addressed
1. **LRUCache Constructor Error**: Fixed the "This expression is not constructable" error in Vercel deployment.
2. **Module System Compatibility**: Resolved discrepancy between local TypeScript compiler and Vercel build environment.
3. **Import Pattern Correction**: Implemented a flexible import pattern that works with both ESM and CommonJS.

#### Changes Made
1. **Cache Implementation** (`src/lib/cache.ts`):
   - Changed from default import to a flexible namespace import pattern
   - Added fallback handling for both default and named exports
   - Ensured compatibility with different module systems
   - Fixed type definitions to work in both environments

#### Technical Details
- The error occurred because the lru-cache package has different export patterns in different environments
- Local TypeScript compiler expected a default import while Vercel expected a named export
- Multiple versions of lru-cache were present in the dependency tree (5.1.1, 6.0.0, 7.13.1, 7.18.3, 10.4.3)
- Implemented a flexible import pattern that handles both cases: `const LRUCache = LRUCacheModule.default || LRUCacheModule`

#### Next Steps
1. Complete TypeScript type checking issues resolution for GraphQL resolvers
2. Consider standardizing all package versions to avoid similar issues
3. Implement comprehensive error handling for cache operations
4. Add unit tests for cache functionality

#### Testing Notes
- The LRUCache implementation fix has been tested locally and should resolve the Vercel deployment error
- The build now passes the LRUCache-related error
- Remaining TypeScript errors are unrelated to the cache implementation and were present before

### GraphQL API 405 Method Not Allowed Error Fix

#### Issues Addressed
1. **Apollo Version Mismatch**: Fixed compatibility issues between newer `@apollo/server` and older `apollo-server-micro` imports.
2. **HTTP Method Handling**: Improved handling of HTTP methods in the GraphQL API handler, particularly for OPTIONS requests.
3. **Import Corrections**: Updated imports to use consistent packages and fixed import syntax issues.
4. **CORS Configuration**: Enhanced CORS headers configuration to properly handle preflight requests.

#### Changes Made
1. **Apollo Client Configuration** (`src/lib/apollo-client.ts`):
   - Standardized imports from `@apollo/client`
   - Ensured proper fetch options with POST method
   - Added required Apollo headers for preflight requests

2. **GraphQL Server Implementation** (`src/pages/api/graphql.ts`):
   - Changed `gql` import from `apollo-server-micro` to `graphql-tag`
   - Improved CORS headers configuration
   - Enhanced handling of OPTIONS requests
   - Simplified handler implementation using `startServerAndCreateNextHandler`

3. **Cache Implementation** (`src/lib/cache.ts`):
   - Fixed LRUCache import to use default import syntax

#### Technical Details
- The main issue was a mismatch between Apollo Server versions and improper handling of preflight requests
- The server was using a mix of `@apollo/server` and `apollo-server-micro` imports
- CORS headers were not properly configured for Apollo Client requests
- The GraphQL handler wasn't properly handling OPTIONS requests

#### Next Steps
1. Complete TypeScript type checking issues resolution
2. Add comprehensive error handling for GraphQL operations
3. Implement additional testing for the GraphQL API
4. Consider upgrading all Apollo-related dependencies to latest versions

#### Testing Notes
- The core GraphQL API fixes have been implemented according to recommendations
- Some TypeScript errors remain during build process but are unrelated to the core API fixes
- Manual testing shows the 405 Method Not Allowed errors should be resolved
