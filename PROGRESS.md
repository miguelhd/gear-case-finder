# Gear Case Finder - Progress Report

## Session Summary - March 26, 2025

In this session, we addressed two critical issues in the Gear Case Finder project:

1. Missing UI styling
2. 405 Method Not Allowed errors in GraphQL API requests

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UI Styling Issue

**Problem:** The UI had no styling applied despite Tailwind CSS being included in the project dependencies.

**Root Cause:** Missing Tailwind CSS configuration files. The project was missing both `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files, which are required for Tailwind CSS to properly process and apply styles.

**Solution:** Created the necessary configuration files:
- Added `tailwind.config.js` with proper content paths, dark mode support, and theme extensions
- Added `postcss.config.js` with the required plugins configuration

### 2. 405 Method Not Allowed Error

**Problem:** The application was showing 405 errors when trying to access the GraphQL API, with error messages:
- "Error loading categories"
- "Error loading brands"
- "Error loading gear items. Please try again later."

**Root Cause:** Mismatch between server and client Apollo configurations. The server was using '@apollo/server' and '@as-integrations/next' while the client was using '@apollo/client'. Additionally, the client configuration was missing the Apollo-specific headers that were added to the server's CORS configuration.

**Solution:** Updated the Apollo client configuration in `src/lib/apollo-client.ts`:
- Added the required Apollo-specific authentication headers:
  - 'apollo-require-preflight': 'true'
  - 'Apollo-Require-Preflight': 'true'
- Explicitly set the fetchOptions method to 'POST' to ensure the client is using the correct HTTP method

## Next Steps

1. Continue developing the product matching algorithm
2. Implement additional filtering options for gear and cases
3. Enhance the UI with more interactive elements
4. Improve error handling and user feedback
5. Add more comprehensive testing

## Technical Notes

- The project uses Next.js with Tailwind CSS for styling
- GraphQL API is implemented using Apollo Server and Apollo Client
- Authentication is currently disabled in the GraphQL API handler
- The application follows a component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
