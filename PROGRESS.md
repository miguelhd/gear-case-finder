# Gear Case Finder Project Progress

## March 28, 2025 - AliExpress API Implementation and TypeScript Fixes

### Completed Tasks

1. **Implemented AliExpress API Integration**
   - Created three key files:
     - `aliexpress-api-client.ts`: Handles communication with the AliExpress API via RapidAPI
     - `aliexpress-data-mapper.ts`: Transforms API responses into the application's standard format
     - `aliexpress-api-service.ts`: Provides business logic, caching, and high-level functionality
   - Integrated the AliExpress API into the existing codebase by updating `api-manager.ts` and `api-factory.ts`
   - Added environment variable support for AliExpress RapidAPI key

2. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**
   - Fixed cache service parameter issues in the AliExpress API service
   - Implemented missing methods in the ApiManager class
   - Fixed property initialization issues
   - Updated the findMatchingCases method to handle different dimensions structures
   - Fixed interface mismatch issues in both getAudioGearDetails and getCaseDetails methods
   - Changed ReverbApiClient method calls from getProduct to getItem

3. **Created Comprehensive Tests**
   - Added `aliexpress-api.test.ts` with tests for the client, data mapper, and service
   - Fixed test configuration issues with ts-jest

### Current Status

The AliExpress API integration is now complete and all TypeScript errors in the main application code have been fixed. The application should now build and deploy successfully on Vercel.

### Next Steps

1. **Enhance Test Coverage**
   - Fix remaining TypeScript errors in test files
   - Add more comprehensive tests for the AliExpress API integration
   - Implement end-to-end tests for the entire product matching flow

2. **Improve API Integration**
   - Add more API sources for product data
   - Implement more sophisticated product matching algorithms
   - Enhance caching strategies to minimize external API calls

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Update the user interface to showcase products from different sources
   - Implement filters for different marketplaces
   - Add sorting options for search results

### Lessons Learned

1. **TypeScript Error Resolution**
   - Analyze the entire codebase for similar patterns rather than fixing errors one by one
   - Check all method signatures and parameter types across the codebase to ensure consistency
   - Verify that interfaces match their implementations throughout the project

2. **API Integration**
   - Use a consistent pattern for API clients, data mappers, and services
   - Implement proper error handling and logging
   - Use caching to minimize external API calls

3. **Testing**
   - Ensure tests are properly mocked to avoid external API calls
   - Use TypeScript properly in test files to catch errors early
   - Test both success and error scenarios

### Summary

The AliExpress API integration has been successfully implemented and all TypeScript errors in the main application code have been fixed. The application should now build and deploy successfully on Vercel. The next steps are to enhance test coverage, improve API integration, and update the user interface to showcase products from different sources.
