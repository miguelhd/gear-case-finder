## Latest Update: March 26, 2025

### GraphQL API 405 Method Not Allowed Error Fix

#### Issues Addressed
1. **Apollo Version Mismatch**: Fixed compatibility issues between newer `@apollo/server` and older `apollo-server-micro` imports.
2. **HTTP Method Handling**: Improved handling of HTTP methods in the GraphQL API handler, particularly for OPTIONS requests.
3. **Import Corrections**: Updated imports to use consistent packages and fixed import syntax issues.
4. **CORS Configuration**: Enhanced CORS headers configuration to properly handle preflight requests.

#### Changes Made
1. **Apollo Client Configuration** (`src/lib/apollo-client.ts`):
   - Standardized imports from `@apollo/client`
   - Ensured proper fetch options with POST method
   - Added required Apollo headers for preflight requests

2. **GraphQL Server Implementation** (`src/pages/api/graphql.ts`):
   - Changed `gql` import from `apollo-server-micro` to `graphql-tag`
   - Improved CORS headers configuration
   - Enhanced handling of OPTIONS requests
   - Simplified handler implementation using `startServerAndCreateNextHandler`

3. **Cache Implementation** (`src/lib/cache.ts`):
   - Fixed LRUCache import to use default import syntax

#### Technical Details
- The main issue was a mismatch between Apollo Server versions and improper handling of preflight requests
- The server was using a mix of `@apollo/server` and `apollo-server-micro` imports
- CORS headers were not properly configured for Apollo Client requests
- The GraphQL handler wasn't properly handling OPTIONS requests

#### Next Steps
1. Complete TypeScript type checking issues resolution
2. Add comprehensive error handling for GraphQL operations
3. Implement additional testing for the GraphQL API
4. Consider upgrading all Apollo-related dependencies to latest versions

#### Testing Notes
- The core GraphQL API fixes have been implemented according to recommendations
- Some TypeScript errors remain during build process but are unrelated to the core API fixes
- Manual testing shows the 405 Method Not Allowed errors should be resolved
