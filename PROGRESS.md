# Gear Case Finder - Progress Log

## March 28, 2025 - Matching System for Admin Dashboard

### Implemented Features
- Created a comprehensive Matching System section in the Admin Dashboard:
  - Implemented algorithm configuration interface for adjusting matching parameters
  - Added manual matching operations functionality for running matches on demand
  - Developed match statistics visualization with detailed metrics and charts
  - Created dashboard with key performance indicators for the matching system

- Implemented new modal components for the Matching System:
  - `AlgorithmConfigModal`: For configuring matching algorithm parameters
  - `ManualMatchingModal`: For running manual matching operations
  - `MatchStatisticsModal`: For viewing detailed match statistics

- Added API endpoints for the Matching System:
  - `/api/admin/matching/parameters`: For saving algorithm configuration
  - `/api/admin/matching/run`: For executing manual matching operations
  - `/api/admin/matching/statistics`: For retrieving detailed match statistics
  - `/api/admin/matching/dashboard-stats`: For fetching dashboard metrics

- Fixed TypeScript errors systematically across the codebase:
  - Implemented proper typing for MongoDB populated documents
  - Fixed import path issues in nested component directories
  - Added missing props to components based on their interfaces
  - Ensured consistent prop types across all components

### Technical Details
- The Matching System dashboard displays:
  - Total matches count
  - High-quality matches count
  - Average match score
  - Last matching run information
  - Recent matches with compatibility scores

- The algorithm configuration allows adjusting:
  - Dimension matching weights
  - Brand compatibility factors
  - Minimum compatibility thresholds
  - Special case handling rules

- Manual matching operations support:
  - Running matches for specific gear types
  - Filtering by brands or categories
  - Setting custom thresholds for the operation
  - Viewing real-time progress and results

- Match statistics visualization includes:
  - Score distribution charts
  - Matches by gear type breakdown
  - Matches by case type breakdown
  - Detailed match history with filtering options

### Challenges Faced
- TypeScript errors related to MongoDB document typing:
  - Property access on populated fields that TypeScript saw as strings
  - Needed to create proper interfaces for populated documents
  - Implemented type guards to safely access properties

- Component integration challenges:
  - Ensuring consistent prop passing between nested components
  - Managing state across multiple modals and the main dashboard
  - Handling asynchronous operations with proper loading states

- Path resolution issues:
  - Fixed import paths in nested component directories
  - Ensured consistent relative path usage across the codebase

### Next Steps
- Implement user feedback analysis section in the Admin Dashboard
- Add performance monitoring features
- Implement export functionality for database items
- Add batch operations for managing multiple items at once
- Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms

## March 28, 2025 - Modal Components for Admin Dashboard

### Implemented Features
- Created reusable modal components for the Admin Dashboard:
  - `ModalBase`: A foundation component for all modals with consistent styling and behavior
  - `DeleteConfirmationModal`: For confirming deletion operations
  - `FormField`: A reusable form input component supporting various input types
  - `GearModal`: For adding/editing audio gear
  - `CaseModal`: For adding/editing cases
  - `MatchModal`: For adding/editing matches
  - `ImportModal`: For importing data
  - `StatusComponents`: Added loading, error, and empty state components

- Integrated modal components into database management pages:
  - Audio Gear Management (`/admin/database/gear`)
  - Case Management (`/admin/database/cases`)
  - Match Management (`/admin/database/matches`)

- Fixed TypeScript errors in API routes:
  - Updated API routes to safely access properties using the `get()` method
  - Added proper type handling for query parameters that could be strings or arrays

- Added required dependencies:
  - Installed `@heroicons/react` for icons
  - Installed `@headlessui/react` for accessible UI components

### Technical Details
- All modals follow a consistent pattern with:
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Form validation
  - Loading states during API operations
  - Error handling
  - Responsive design

- The modals support the following operations:
  - Add: Create new items with form validation
  - Edit: Modify existing items with pre-filled form fields
  - Delete: Confirm deletion with a warning message
  - Import: Upload data files (JSON/CSV)

### Challenges Faced
- TypeScript errors related to spread types in nested objects
- Property access on MongoDB document objects
- Handling query parameters that could be strings or arrays
- Ensuring proper prop types for all components

### Next Steps
- Implement user feedback analysis section in the Admin Dashboard
- Add performance monitoring features
- Enhance the matching algorithm configuration interface
- Implement export functionality for database items
- Add batch operations for managing multiple items at once
