- Detailed MongoDB Atlas configuration, database structure, and indexes
- Outlined data import process and admin dashboard implementation
- Documented integration with existing application
- Added testing and deployment plans

#### 6. Admin Dashboard UI Development
- Created directory structure for admin dashboard pages and components
- Implemented admin layout with navigation sidebar
- Created dashboard overview page with stats and recent activity
- Developed scraper management interface with status indicators and controls
- Built database management tools for collection viewing and data import
- Implemented system monitoring visualizations for logs and health metrics
- Fixed Link component implementation for Next.js compatibility

#### 7. Admin Dashboard Testing
- Tested admin dashboard functionality with MongoDB Atlas connection
- Verified all navigation and UI components render correctly
- Fixed rendering issues with Next.js Link components
- Ensured compatibility with latest Next.js version

#### 8. Deployment Error Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript error in scrapers.tsx that was preventing successful Vercel deployment
- Added proper type annotation to selectedScrapers array (useState<string[]>([]) instead of useState([]))
- Added type annotation to scraperId parameter in toggleScraperSelection function
- Verified fix with successful local build
- Ensured compatibility with Vercel deployment environment

#### 9. GraphQL API Error Resolution
- Fixed 405 Method Not Allowed error in GraphQL API endpoint
- Identified root cause as improper initialization of Apollo Server in Vercel's serverless environment
- Completely refactored GraphQL API implementation to be compatible with Vercel's serverless functions:
  - Removed problematic async IIFE pattern for server initialization that was causing issues in serverless context
  - Enhanced CORS configuration with proper headers for preflight requests
  - Added explicit handling of OPTIONS requests for CORS preflight
  - Fixed TypeScript errors in MongoDB aggregation pipeline by using proper literal types (1 | -1)
  - Added detailed request logging for better debugging in production
  - Improved error handling throughout the GraphQL resolvers
- Verified fix with successful local build and testing
- Ensured proper handling of all HTTP methods in the GraphQL endpoint
- Implemented best practices for Apollo Server deployment in Vercel's serverless environment

#### 10. Vercel Configuration Fix
- Fixed JSON parsing error in vercel.json that was preventing successful deployment
- Identified root cause as an invalid comment line in the JSON file (JSON format doesn't support comments)
- Removed the comment while preserving all actual configuration settings
- Validated the JSON syntax using Node.js JSON.parse to ensure correctness
- Verified fix with successful local build
- Committed and pushed changes to resolve the deployment error
- Ensured proper configuration for GraphQL API routing and CORS headers in Vercel environment

#### 11. GraphQL Schema Validation Fix
- Fixed GraphQL schema validation error that was causing 405 Method Not Allowed errors in production
- Identified root cause as the use of reserved field name "__typename" in both GraphQL schema and resolvers
- Replaced the reserved "__typename" field with "apiStatus" in schema.ts and resolvers.ts files
- Thoroughly tested the fix by cleaning build cache and rebuilding the project
- Verified that the schema validation error was resolved
- Committed and pushed changes to fix the GraphQL API endpoint in production
- Ensured proper GraphQL introspection and schema validation

#### 12. MongoDB Connection Error Handling
- Fixed persistent 405 Method Not Allowed errors in production by addressing the underlying MongoDB connection issue
- Identified root cause through Vercel deployment logs analysis: MongoDB connection failure due to DNS resolution error
- Discovered critical mismatch between local MongoDB connection string and production environment variable
- Implemented comprehensive error handling in mongodb.ts to prevent application crashes during database connection failures
- Enhanced GraphQL API handler to continue functioning even when database connection fails
- Added detailed logging for MongoDB connection attempts and failures to aid in debugging
- Created test scripts to verify MongoDB connectivity and GraphQL API resilience
- Committed and pushed changes to make the application more robust against database connection issues
- Provided instructions for updating the MongoDB URI environment variable in Vercel to match local configuration

#### 13. Database Seeding Script Implementation
- Created comprehensive database seeding script for testing user flows
- Implemented generator modules for all seven collections:
  - AudioGear: Generates realistic audio equipment data with various categories and specifications
  - Case: Creates protective cases with different protection levels and dimensions
  - GearCaseMatch: Establishes compatibility matches between gear and cases with scoring
  - User: Generates user profiles with preferences and history
  - Content: Creates articles, guides, reviews, and tutorials
  - Analytics: Provides usage analytics data for monitoring
  - Affiliate: Sets up affiliate program data
- Added configuration options for controlling the amount of generated data
- Implemented proper error handling and logging throughout the seeding process
- Created indexes for optimized queries
- Successfully tested the script by populating the MongoDB database
- Verified local test suite compatibility with Vercel deployment environment

### Next Steps

#### 1. Database Setup and Integration
- Complete MongoDB Atlas setup (user task) ✅
