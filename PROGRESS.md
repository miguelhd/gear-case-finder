# Progress Report - March 26, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 504 Gateway Timeout with "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT" message
- **Root Cause**: GraphQL resolver functions were taking too long to execute in Vercel's serverless environment
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added timeout handling using Promise.race pattern with 10-second limits for all database operations
  - Optimized database queries using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline with $facet to combine item fetching and count operations
  - Implemented database indexing for frequently queried fields to improve query performance
  - Fixed Apollo Server configuration for better compatibility with Vercel
  - Added robust error handling to return partial results instead of failing completely

### 2. 405 Method Not Allowed error in GraphQL API
- **Root Cause**: Missing CORS configuration in the GraphQL API handler, causing it to reject OPTIONS requests
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Added proper CORS configuration using the micro-cors package
  - Added explicit handling for OPTIONS requests to respond correctly to browser preflight checks
  - Added appropriate CORS headers to all responses
  - Configured allowed HTTP methods and headers

### 3. Repository Management
- Added proper .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and build artifacts from Git tracking

## Technical Details

### Timeout Handling Implementation
- Used Promise.race to set a 10-second timeout for database operations
- Created a timeout promise that rejects after 10 seconds
- Raced this against the actual database operation
- Added error handling to return partial results instead of failing completely

### Database Query Optimization
- Replaced separate find() and countDocuments() calls with MongoDB's aggregation pipeline
- Used $facet to fetch items and count in a single query
- Implemented proper sorting and pagination within the aggregation pipeline

### Database Indexing
- Added single-field indexes for frequently queried fields:
  - brand, category, type, price, rating
  - Added text indexes for name and description fields
- Created compound indexes for common filter combinations:
  - brand + category
  - category + type
  - waterproof + shockproof + dustproof

### CORS Configuration
- Used micro-cors package to handle CORS properly
- Added explicit handling for OPTIONS requests
- Configured the following CORS headers:
  - Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  - Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
  - Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With
  - Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the changes to Vercel to verify the fixes in production
2. Consider implementing caching for expensive queries to further improve performance
3. Address the security vulnerabilities reported by GitHub Dependabot
4. Implement pagination for large result sets to further optimize performance
5. Consider adding monitoring and logging to track resolver execution times

All changes have been tested locally with successful builds and pushed to the GitHub repository.
