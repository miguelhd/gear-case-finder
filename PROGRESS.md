# Progress Report - March 27, 2025 (Update 2)

## Project: Gear Case Finder - API Integration and Optimization

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. API Alternative Research
- Conducted in-depth research on API alternatives to replace scrapers
- Evaluated multiple options including Canopy API, Reverb API, and specialized sources
- Focused on user-centric approach to find diverse case options for musical equipment
- Identified cross-industry sources for unique case options (makeup cases, tool cases, etc.)
- Researched dimensional search capabilities to match instruments with cases

#### 2. Reverb API Integration
- Created Reverb API client for accessing musical instrument data
- Implemented data mapper to transform API responses to internal data models
- Developed service layer for MongoDB integration and search functionality
- Focused on musical instruments and specialized gear cases

#### 3. Canopy API Integration
- Implemented Canopy API client for accessing product data across marketplaces
- Added support for dimensional searching to find cases that match specific gear dimensions
- Created methods for searching audio gear and protective cases
- Designed for efficient API usage with parameter optimization
- Implemented comprehensive data mapper for transforming API responses to internal models

#### 4. Dimension Caching System
- Developed comprehensive dimension cache service to reduce API calls
- Pre-populated cache with 30+ common desktop and handheld electronic instruments
- Implemented dimension normalization and unit conversion
- Created efficient indexes for dimensional queries
- Added support for accessory space in case matching algorithm

#### 5. API Call Optimization Strategies
- Designed caching system with MongoDB for persistent storage
- Implemented different TTL values for different types of data
- Created batch processing system for scheduled updates to reduce real-time API calls
- Implemented smart prefetching strategies for dimensional data
- Created permanent storage for static instrument dimensions

### Next Steps

#### 1. Integration with Existing Application
- Integrate API clients and services with the existing application
- Replace scraper-based data acquisition with API-based approach
- Implement UI components for accessory space configuration
- Connect dimension cache to the case matching algorithm

#### 2. Testing and Verification
- Verify test suite compatibility with new API integrations
- Test functionality with real instrument dimensions
- Validate case matching accuracy
- Measure API call reduction with optimization strategies

#### 3. Documentation and Deployment
- Update documentation with new API integration details
- Document dimension caching system
- Prepare for deployment with environment variable configuration
- Create user guide for adding new instrument dimensions

### Implementation Details

The implementation focuses on replacing scrapers with efficient API integrations while optimizing for reduced API calls. Key components include:

1. **API Clients**: Implemented for Reverb and Canopy APIs with standardized interfaces
2. **Data Mappers**: Transform API responses to internal data models with intelligent attribute extraction
3. **Caching Service**: MongoDB-based caching with configurable TTL values for different data types
4. **Dimension Cache**: Permanently stores static instrument dimensions with accessory space requirements
5. **Batch Processing**: Scheduled jobs for refreshing product data, dimension data, and price data at different intervals

The approach prioritizes finding diverse case options for musical equipment, including non-obvious sources like makeup cases, tool cases, and other protective containers that match instrument dimensions.

### Notes
- Focus is on desktop and handheld electronic instruments
- Added support for accessory space in case matching
- Implemented dimension-specific optimizations to reduce API calls
- Designed for user-centric outcomes rather than direct scraper replacement
- Prioritized finding unique case options across diverse sources
