   - Identified module format incompatibility between project settings and Node.js expectations
   - Discovered path resolution issues when running TypeScript files directly

2. **Implemented Comprehensive Solution**
   - Created separate TypeScript configuration for scripts (tsconfig.scripts.json)
   - Developed a robust script runner with proper path resolution (scripts/run-script.js)
   - Updated package.json with new script commands for running TypeScript scripts
   - Tested the solution with the database population script

3. **Documented Solution and Approach**
   - Created detailed documentation of the root causes and solution
   - Included implementation details with code snippets
   - Documented lessons learned for future reference

### Current Status

The TypeScript execution issues with the database population script have been resolved by implementing a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes rather than fixing individual errors. The solution includes a separate TypeScript configuration for scripts that uses CommonJS modules, a script runner with proper path resolution, and updated npm script commands. The database population script now executes without TypeScript-related errors, though there are API-related issues (429 Too Many Requests) which are separate from the TypeScript execution issues.

### Technical Details

1. **Root Causes Identified**
   - Module Format Incompatibility: The project's main tsconfig.json uses "module": "esnext" which is incompatible with direct ts-node execution in Node.js v22
   - Path Resolution Issues: Relative path resolution in the script runner was causing "MODULE_NOT_FOUND" errors

2. **Solution Components**
   - tsconfig.scripts.json: Extends the main configuration but uses CommonJS modules
   - scripts/run-script.js: Helper that registers ts-node with the scripts-specific tsconfig and uses absolute path resolution
   - Updated package.json scripts: Added new commands for running TypeScript scripts

3. **Testing Results**
   - The database population script now executes without TypeScript-related errors
   - API-related issues (429 Too Many Requests) are present but separate from the TypeScript execution issues

### Next Steps

1. **Address API Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API requests
   - Add proper handling for rate limit responses
   - Consider implementing request queuing to manage API call frequency

2. **Enhance Database Population Script**
   - Add more robust error handling for different API error scenarios
   - Implement logging to track progress and issues
   - Add support for partial success scenarios

3. **Extend Script Runner Capabilities**
   - Add support for command-line arguments to scripts
   - Implement environment variable management
   - Add script dependency management

### Lessons Learned

1. **Module System Compatibility**
   - Next.js projects typically use ESM modules ("module": "esnext") which can cause issues with direct ts-node execution
   - Creating a separate TypeScript configuration for scripts allows for different module systems in different contexts

2. **Path Resolution in Node.js**
   - Absolute paths are more reliable than relative paths for script execution
   - Always verify file existence before attempting to require/import files
   - Use Node.js path module for cross-platform path resolution

3. **TypeScript Configuration Management**
   - Extending the base configuration allows for specialized settings without duplication
   - Different parts of a project may need different TypeScript settings

4. **Root Cause Analysis Approach**
   - Analyzing the root causes of issues leads to more robust solutions than fixing individual errors
   - Understanding the underlying configuration and environment is crucial for effective troubleshooting

### Summary

The TypeScript execution issues with the database population script have been successfully resolved by implementing a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes. The solution provides a robust foundation for running TypeScript scripts in the project, with proper module resolution and path handling. This approach ensures that scripts can be executed reliably while maintaining the project's main TypeScript configuration for the Next.js application.
