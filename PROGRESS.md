# Gear Case Finder - Progress Log

## March 28, 2025 - Modal Components for Admin Dashboard

### Implemented Features
- Created reusable modal components for the Admin Dashboard:
  - `ModalBase`: A foundation component for all modals with consistent styling and behavior
  - `DeleteConfirmationModal`: For confirming deletion operations
  - `FormField`: A reusable form input component supporting various input types
  - `GearModal`: For adding/editing audio gear
  - `CaseModal`: For adding/editing cases
  - `MatchModal`: For adding/editing matches
  - `ImportModal`: For importing data
  - `StatusComponents`: Added loading, error, and empty state components

- Integrated modal components into database management pages:
  - Audio Gear Management (`/admin/database/gear`)
  - Case Management (`/admin/database/cases`)
  - Match Management (`/admin/database/matches`)

- Fixed TypeScript errors in API routes:
  - Updated API routes to safely access properties using the `get()` method
  - Added proper type handling for query parameters that could be strings or arrays

- Added required dependencies:
  - Installed `@heroicons/react` for icons
  - Installed `@headlessui/react` for accessible UI components

### Technical Details
- All modals follow a consistent pattern with:
  - Proper TypeScript interfaces for props
  - Form validation
  - Loading states during API operations
  - Error handling
  - Responsive design

- The modals support the following operations:
  - Add: Create new items with form validation
  - Edit: Modify existing items with pre-filled form fields
  - Delete: Confirm deletion with a warning message
  - Import: Upload data files (JSON/CSV)

### Challenges Faced
- TypeScript errors related to spread types in nested objects
- Property access on MongoDB document objects
- Handling query parameters that could be strings or arrays
- Ensuring proper prop types for all components

### Next Steps
- Implement user feedback analysis section in the Admin Dashboard
- Add performance monitoring features
- Enhance the matching algorithm configuration interface
- Implement export functionality for database items
- Add batch operations for managing multiple items at once
